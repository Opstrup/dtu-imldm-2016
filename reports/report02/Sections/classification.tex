\section{Classification}
The 58th attribute was used to solve the classification problem for the dataset, which was detecting spam from non-spam. The 58th attribute is binary and indicates spam or non-spam, spam = 1 and non-spam = 0.

Some earlier classification analysis have been done to the dataset before with a classification rate 7\%. The methods for obtaining this rate is unfornatly unknown.
