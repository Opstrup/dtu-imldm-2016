\subsection{Comparing Artificial Neural Network with Linear regression}
For comparing the two methods of regression a series of t-tests have been run on the results from each method. The mean squared errors of the ANN and the mean squared test errors from the Linear Regression was used for the t-tests. With a t-value of 2.89173 and corresponding p-value of 0.01783, there is a strong indication that the Artificial Neural Network is a better fit for regression on the dataset.
