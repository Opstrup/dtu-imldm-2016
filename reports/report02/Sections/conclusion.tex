\section{Conclusion}
In the regression part we want to predict the variable word-freq-credit. But error rate is quite high. For the linear regression part, the error rate if above 0.9 even when we model it with feature selection. The modeling result using Artificial Neural Network is better than linear regression, but still has a high mean-square error of 0.9134.

However, when we do the decision problem of checking whether an email is SPAM or not. The prediction result is much better. For both ANN and KNN method we have a test error rate below 10\%. And ANN perform better with 6.89\% error rate. This shows that predicting spam email with these attributes is somehow effective.
