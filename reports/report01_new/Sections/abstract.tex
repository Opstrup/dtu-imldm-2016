	% % % OLD ABSTRACT % % % This document contains a brief overview of the Cubesat Space Protocol, of the eCos operating system, as well as requirements on how to port CSP to eCos for use in satellites.
	
	This document gives an overview of how to implement the \CSP{} on the eCos operating system, document relevant features of \CSP{}. It documents the currently used satellite communication protocol used at DTU, and compares these on a variety of factors. Also, implementation details are given regarding how the operating system specific subsystems have been implemented, along with notes on use of Error Correcting Codes. Basic testing shows equal operation of \CSP{} on Linux and eCos.
