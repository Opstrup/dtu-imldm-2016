\label{sec:intro}

This report covers the first assignment for course \textit{02450: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining}. The assignments purpose is to initially describe, analyze and reduce a chosen dataset. The chosen dataset is a set of forest fires, with the dataset the main goal is to try to predict future forest fires. The report will describe the types and summary statistics of the datas attributes and seek to find which PCA components the data can be reduced to. Furthermore the report will cover which future analysis and machine learning can be applied.
