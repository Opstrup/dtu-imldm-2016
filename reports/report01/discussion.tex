\section{Discussion}
After analysing the dataset, the group is a bit concerned if the dataset is big enough. With only around 500 records and 11 attributes, the dataset is a bit small. The boxplot shows that there is a lot of outliers in the dataset and no concrete data class where to be found in the dataset, which made the pc-analyse very hard.
