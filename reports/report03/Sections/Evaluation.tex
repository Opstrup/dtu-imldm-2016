\section{Evaluation}

Comparing the GMM and hierarchical clustering, GMM classifies the data into 5 clusters in which one of them has low purity, while other clusters are so centralized that should be classified into the same cluster. In the hierarchical clustering, two objects merges in each time of the clustering, and it formed a dendrogram which is better cut into three classes. Hierarchical clustering has less error in classification because the data in the same cluster are the clostest, acroding to the standardized euclidean and single linkage. Also the clusters are not as big as the one in GMM, which means the clusters are more specific.
