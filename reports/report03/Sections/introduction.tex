\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

For this report, the group use the same dataset as project 2, which is the SPAM dataset from http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ ElemStatLearn/. The dataset is mainly used to detect SPAM emails using attributes such as the frequency of centain words and capital letters.

The group will focus unsupervised learning methods in this report. We will first apply Gaussian Mixture Model and Hierarchical Clustering for clustering the data. Then we use different anomal detection methods to detect outliers. In the association mining part we want to find whether there is correlation between different attributes.
