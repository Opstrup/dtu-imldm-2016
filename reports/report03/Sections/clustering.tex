\section{Clustering}

Clustering is a classification method in unsupervised learning, which we divide data into groups to capture the natural structure of the data. In this section of the report, we are going to cluster the sparm data using both Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and hierarchical clustering. In the hierarchical clustering, the cut-off is set at the same number of clusters as astimated by the GMM. Also, the comparision of those two methods will be mentioned afterward.
